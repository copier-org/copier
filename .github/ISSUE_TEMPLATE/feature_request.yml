        How does the user work? 💻 What is happening, why is he/she working like this, what problem is he/she encountering, why is it causing him/her frustration?

        If you want, you can put a 📼 video where you record the use case that is problematic, or just some 📸 screenshots.

        Don't just state the problem in the program itself. **Also explain how it impacts the user's real world**.

        What would the user want to happen instead of what is happening?

        Explain it broadly, without going into details of how you would implement the solution.

        Don't just think about what would **solve the problem** 💪, but also think about what would **reduce frustration** 🤩.

        As humans, when we see a problem, it's hard not to think of a solution - and that's a good thing! 👷

        In this section, you can propose what you think would be the ideal solution.

        - You can give as many technical details as you see fit.
        - You can design a draft interface of the solution.
        - The most valued solutions are the MVP solutions.

        But, important: your solution **is just a proposal**; don't get upset if it doesn't end up being the final solution. 😃
