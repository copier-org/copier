# Template Inheritance and Composition

## What is Inheritace, what is Composition?

Template Inheritance is a way to create a new template based on an existing one. It
allows you to reuse code and structure from the parent template while adding or
overriding specific parts in the child template. This is useful for creating variations
of a template without duplicating code.

Template Composition, on the other hand, is a way to combine multiple templates,
independent of each other, into a single new template. In this way you can join the
functionalities of multiple templates, by adding some "glue code", and avoid repetition.
