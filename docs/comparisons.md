# Comparing Copier to other project generators

The subject of
[code scaffolding](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffold_(programming)>) has been

Here's a simple comparison. If you find something wrong, please open a PR and fix these
docs! We don't want to be biased, but it's easy that we tend to be:

!!! important

    Although Copier was born as a code scaffolding tool, it is today a code lifecycle
    management tool. This makes it somehow unique. Most tools below are only scaffolders
    and the comparison is not complete due to that.

[^1]:
    The file itself can
    [include other YAML files](configuring.md#include-other-yaml-files).

[^2]:
    Git repo is recommended to be able to use advanced features such as template tagging
    and smart updates.

[^3]:
    A suffix is required by default. Defaults to `.jinja`, but can be configured to use
    a different suffix, or to use none.

[^4]:
    Only for git templates, because Copier uses git tags to obtain available versions
    and extract smart diffs between them.

[^5]: Context hooks are provided through the [`ContextHook` extension][context-hook].
