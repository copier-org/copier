    specification.

#### Other

-   Added `prettier`, `black` and `isort` for code formatting.
-   Added `pytest` for running tests.
-   Use `plumbum` as CLI and subprocess engine.

### Version 2.5 (2019-06)

-   Expanduser on all paths (so "~/foo/bar" is expanded to
    "<YOUR_HOME_FOLDER>/foo/bar").
-   Improve the output when running tasks.
-   Remove the destination folder if the copy process or one of the tasks fail.
-   Add a `cleanup_on_error` flag to optionally disable the cleanup feature.
-   Add the `skip_if_exists` option to skip files, without asking, if they already
    exists in the destination folder.

### Version 2.4.2 (2019-06)

-   Fix MAJOR bug that was preventing the `_exclude`, `_include` and `_tasks` keys from
    `copier.yml` (or alternatives) to be used at all. It also interpreted `_tasks` as a
    user-provided variable.

### Version 2.4 (2019-06)

-   Empty folders are now copied. The folders are also displayed in the console output
    instead of just the files.
-   `prompt_bool` can now have an undefined default (ans answer is mandatory in that
    case).
-   Reactivates the `copier.yml` and `copier.yaml` as configuration files.
-   The new `extra_paths` argument specifies additional paths to find templates to
    inherit from.

### Version 2.3 (2019-04)

-   Back to using a setup.py intead of a pyproject.toml.
-   The recommended configuration file is now `copier.toml`.

### Version 2.2 (2019-04)

-   The `copier` command-line script now accepts "help" and "version" as commands.

### Version 2.1 (2019-02)

-   Task runner ðŸŽ‰.
-   Use `_exclude`, `_include`, and `_tasks` keys in `copier.yml` as the default values
    for the `.copy()` arguments `exclude`, `include`, and `tasks`.

### Version 2.0 (2019-02)

-   Rebranded from `Voodoo` to `Copier`!
-   Dropped support for Python 2.x, the minimal version is now Python 3.5.
-   Cleanup and 100% test coverage.
-   The recommended configuration file is now `copier.yaml`, but a `copier.json` can be
    used as well. The old `voodoo.json` is also supported _for now_ but is deprecated
    and will be removed in version 2.2.
-   Python package format updated to the latest standard (no `setup.py` ðŸ˜µ).
-   Renamed the `render_skeleton()` function to `copy()`. The function signature remains
    almost the same, the only changes are:
    -   `filter_this` parameter is now called `exclude`.
    -   `ignore_this` parameter is now called just `ignore`.
-   Dropped the idea of storing the templates in a hidden `$HOME` folder.
