A library for rendering project templates.

-   Works with **local** paths and **git URLs**.
-   Your project can include any file and `Copier` can dynamically replace values in any
    kind of text file.
-   It generates a beautiful output and takes care of not overwrite existing files
    unless instructed to do so.

    # You can also use "gh:" as a shortcut of "https://github.com/"
    copy("gh:copier-org/copier.git", "path/to/destination")

    # Or "gl:" as a shortcut of "https://gitlab.com/"
    copy("gl:copier-org/copier.git", "path/to/destination")
    ```

    ```
