# Copier Â· [![](https://travis-ci.org/jpscaletti/copier.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jpscaletti/copier/) [![](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/copier.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/copier) [![](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/copier.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/copier)

A library for rendering projects templates.

* Works with **local** paths and **git URLs**.
* Your project can include any file and `Copier` can dynamically replace values in any kind of text files.
* It generates a beautiful output and take care of not overwrite existing files, unless instructed to do so.

## How to use

- Use it in your Python code:

```python
from copier import copy

# Create a project from a local path
copy('path/to/project/template', 'path/to/destination')

# Or from a git URL.
copy('https://github.com/jpscaletti/copier.git', 'path/to/destination')

# You can also use "gh:" as a shortcut of "https://github.com/"
copy('gh:jpscaletti/copier.git', 'path/to/destination')

# Or "gl:"  as a shortcut of "https://gitlab.com/"
copy('gl:jpscaletti/copier.git', 'path/to/destination')
```

- Or as a command-line tool:

```bash
copier path/to/project/template path/to/destination
```

## Prompt the user for information (copier.yml)

If a YAML file named `copier.yml` (alternatively, a `copier.json` ) is found in the root
of the project, it will be used to prompt the user to fill or confirm the values before
become avaliable to the project template.

```yaml
name_of_the_project: "My awesome project"
your_email: null
number_of_eels: 1234

# Shell-style patterns files/folders that must not be copied.
_exclude:
    - *.bar

# Shell-style patterns files/folders that *must be* copied, even if
# they are in the exclude list
-include:
    - foo.bar

# Commands to be executed after the copy
_tasks:
    - git init
    - rm [[ name_of_the_project ]]/README.md

```

In this file, the keys `_exclude`, `_include` and `_tasks` have special meaning.

`_exclude`, `_include`, and `_tasks`  will be treated as the default values for the
`exclude`, `include`, and `tasks`  arguments of `copier.copy()`.
However, any explicitely passed argument will overwrite them.

> **Warning:** Use only trusted project templates as these tasks
> run with the same level of access as your user.


## How it works

The content of the files inside the project template are copied to the destination
without changes, **unless are suffixed with the extension '.tmpl'.**
In that case, the templating engine will be used to render them.

A slightly customized Jinja2 templating is used. The main difference is
that variables are referenced with ``[[ name ]]`` instead of
``{{ name }}`` and blocks are ``[% if name %]`` instead of
``{% if name %}``. To read more about templating see the [Jinja2
documentation](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs>).

If a `copier.yml` is found in the root of the project, the user will be prompted to
fill or confirm the values.

Use the `extra_data` argument to pass whatever extra context you want to be available
in the templates. The arguments can be any valid Python value, even a
function.


## API

#### copier.copy()

`copier.copy(src_path, dst_path, data=None, *,
    exclude=DEFAULT_FILTER, include=DEFAULT_INCLUDE, envops=None,
    pretend=False, force=False, skip=False, quiet=False,
)`

Uses the template in src_path to generate a new project at dst_path.

**Arguments**:

- **src_path** (str):
    Absolute path to the project skeleton. May be a version control system URL

- **dst_path** (str):
    Absolute path to where to render the skeleton

- **data** (dict):
    Optional. Data to be passed to the templates in addtion to the user data from
    a `copier.yml`.

- **exclude** (list):
    Optional. A list of names or shell-style patterns matching files or folders
    that mus not be copied.

- **include** (list):
    Optional. A list of names or shell-style patterns matching files or folders that
    must be included, even if its name are in the `exclude` list.
    Eg: `['.gitignore']`. The default is an empty list.

- **tasks** (list):
    Optional lists of commands to run in order after finishing the copy.
    Like in the templates files, you can use variables on the commands that will
    be replaced by the real values before running the command.
    If one of the commands fail, the rest of them will not run.

- **envops** (dict):
    Optional. Extra options for the Jinja template environment.

- **pretend** (bool):
    Optional. Run but do not make any changes

- **force** (bool):
    Optional. Overwrite files that already exist, without asking

- **skip** (bool):
    Optional. Skip files that already exist, without asking

- **quiet** (bool):
    Optional. Suppress the status output
