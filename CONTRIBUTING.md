## Dev Environment Setup

The recommended way is:

1. Click on
   [![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/copier-org/copier)
1. Wait until the terminal that pops up is ready.
1. Accept the direnv and nix pop-ups that appear.

For local or more complex setups, continue reading.

We use some tools as part of our development workflow which you'll need to install into
your host environment:

-   [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) to provide a reproducible development
    environment.
-   [Direnv](https://direnv.net/) to load that environment automatically in your shell.

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up the project for local development.

1.  Fork the Copier repo on GitHub.
1.  Clone your fork locally:

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:my-user/copier.git
    cd copier
    ```

1.  Use Direnv to set up a development environment:

    ```shell
    # Let direnv do its magic
    direnv allow
    ```

    Direnv will take some time to load for the 1st time. It will download all
    development dependencies, including [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), and it
    will use it to create a virtualenv and install Copier with all its development
    dependencies too.

1.  Create a branch for local development:

    ```shell
    git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

1.  When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass all tests:

    ```shell
    poe test
    poe lint
    ```

1.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git add .
    cz commit  # use `git commit` if you prefer, but this helps
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

1.  Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1.  The pull request has code, it should include tests.
1.  Check that all checks pass on GitHub CI.
1.  If something significant changed, modify docs.

## Tips

To run a subset of tests:

```shell
poe test tests/the-tests-file.py
```

### Nix binary cache

Our direnv configuration is configured to use binary caches by default.

However, to add our binary caches permanently:

```shell
nix-shell -p cachix --run 'cachix use copier && cachix use devenv'
```
