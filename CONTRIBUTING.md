## Dev environment setup

We use some tools as part of our development workflow which you'll need to install into
your host environment:

-   [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for packaging and dependency management
-   [poethepoet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) for running development tasks

Or you can use
[![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/copier-org/copier)
to start hacking with one click!

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up the project for local development.

1.  Fork the copier repo on GitHub.
2.  Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:copier-org/copier.git
```

3.  Use poetry to setup a virtualenv to develop in

```bash
poetry install # create's a virtualenv with all dependencies from pyproject.toml
poetry shell   # creates a new shell with the virtualenv activated
```

5.  Create a branch for local development:

```bash
git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

Now you can make your changes locally.

6.  When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass all tests

```bash
poe test
poe lint
```

To have multiple Python versions on the same machine for running `tox`, I recommend
using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) (_do not_ confuse it with `pipenv`,).

7.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Detailed description of your changes."
git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

8.  Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1.  The pull request has code, it should include tests.
2.  Check that all checks pass on GitHub CI

## Tips

To run a subset of tests:

    $  poe test tests/the-tests-file.py
