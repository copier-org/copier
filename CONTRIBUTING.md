## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up the project for local development.

1.  Fork the copier repo on GitHub.
2.  Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jpscaletti/copier.git
```

3.  Install your local copy into a virtualenv.

```bash
python -m virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
make install
```

5.  Create a branch for local development:

```bash
git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

Now you can make your changes locally.

6.  When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass all tests

```bash
pytest -x .
flake8 .
```

To have multiple Python versions on the same machine for running `tox`, I recommend
using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) (_do not_ confuse it with `pipenv`,).

7.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Detailed description of your changes."
git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

8.  Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1.  The pull request has code, it should include tests.
2.  Run `tox` and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

## Tips

To run a subset of tests:

    $  pytest tests/the-tests-file.py
